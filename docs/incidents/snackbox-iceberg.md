## Introduction

The Snackbox Iceberg is an iceberg image made by Gen. On this page, we will go over each entry and hopefully provide a thorough explanation for each one.

## "I fucking love this scene"

Gen (yes, the person who made the iceberg) is a big fan of the anime "March Comes In like a Lion", and he was a big fan of one scene in particular. So, to show his appreciation towards the scene, he decided to post the scene on the discord server with the phrase "fucking love this scene", this would've been fine normally, but the scene begins with this:

The scene is actually fairly innocent, but when the scene starts with that line, you can imagine that some people would find it very funny, and this screenshot would be constantly reposted on the server, and everytime it was posted, it would easily get many star and joy reacts.

Gen would go on to take advantage of this meme, and every now and then, he'll reference this infamous post, to the joy of many Snackbox users.
